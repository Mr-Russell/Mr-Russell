### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! I woud love to collaboarate on any project below, or help you build a new project from scratch. I am always looking to improve my work, so please take a look at my code and let me know if you have any suggestions on improving my code. 

I have always been interested in how technology can improve our everyday lives. I want to solve new problems by building software. I love solving puzzles, and debugging software is a something I actually enjoy and embrace. Once I start a project I am not satisfied until it is fully complete, with all the necessary features built and functioning properly.

I have experience working with:
| HTML | CSS | LESS | Responsive Design | Ant Design | JavaScript | React | Redux | React Testing Library | Cypress | Jest | NodeJS | Express | Knex | SQLite | PostgreSQL | Python
